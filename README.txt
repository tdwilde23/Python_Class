Proposal

I would create an API to help users start their own garden. The API would require location in order to find what plant hardiness zone a user is in. The API will also take in location and output all local plants. The user can search by plant and get information on the plant such as light, water, and ph requirements. It would also output a list of plants that require similar environments.

How to operate my API:

Please download my data from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DwMxn0LTrOU68lZjry7Afvf-YVtjvyhI?usp=sharing and put the resulting file in my project directory. After the datafile is downloaded you can run the API. There are three main uses for this API. The first allows you to put in a zipcode and the API will find your hardiness zone and return any plants that can grow within this hardiness zone. The second search allows you to put in a latin name on a plant and find any similar plants. If the name you type in is not in the database the API will return a table of suggested plants, with a link to find similar plants for each plant. The last search is to find plants by there common names. I added this since I figured most people don't know the latin names of plants. Lastly there is a garden page which has all the plants that the user has saved to there garden and can reference the plants in a smaller table.
